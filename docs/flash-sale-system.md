# Flash Sale System Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design of a flash sale (秒杀) system implemented in our Flask application. A flash sale system enables selling limited-quantity products at discounted prices for a short period, handling high concurrent user traffic while maintaining system stability.

## Core Requirements
1. **High Concurrency Handling**: Support thousands of simultaneous requests
2. **Prevent Overselling**: Ensure inventory accuracy even under high load
3. **Fair Access**: Provide equal opportunity for all users to participate
4. **System Stability**: Prevent system crashes during traffic spikes
5. **Performance**: Respond quickly even under heavy load

## Architecture Components

### 1. Rate Limiting
- Implement token bucket algorithm to control request rates
- Configure per-user and global rate limits

### 2. Inventory Management
- Use Redis for real-time inventory tracking
- Implement atomic operations for inventory updates

### 3. Request Queue
- Implement message queue (using Redis) for asynchronous processing
- Decouple request receiving from order processing

### 4. Caching Layer
- Cache product information and availability status
- Reduce database load during peak times

### 5. Data Consistency
- Implement distributed locks to prevent race conditions
- Use optimistic locking for inventory updates

## API Design

### Flash Sale Product Listing
```
GET /api/flash-sales
```

### Flash Sale Product Details
```
GET /api/flash-sales/{product_id}
```

### Place Flash Sale Order
```
POST /api/flash-sales/{product_id}/order
```

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Basic implementation with Redis-based inventory management
2. **Phase 2**: Add queueing system and rate limiting
3. **Phase 3**: Implement distributed locking and performance optimizations
4. **Phase 4**: Add monitoring and auto-scaling capabilities

## System Flow
1. User requests to participate in flash sale
2. Request passes through rate limiter
3. If inventory is available, place request in queue
4. Worker processes queue and updates inventory atomically
5. Return result to user (success or failure)

## Performance Considerations
- Use connection pooling for database and Redis connections
- Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures
- Consider horizontal scaling for handling traffic spikes
